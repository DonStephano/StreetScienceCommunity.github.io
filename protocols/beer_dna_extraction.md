title: Beer DNA extraction

## Requirements
* a bootle of beer. We used a Chimay.


## Protocol: Beer DNA extraction

* Shake the beer bottle (a bit)
* Transfer into an Erlenmeyer flask (big glass that looks like a triangle)
* Carefully shake the flask to remove a bit of CO2
* Use a large pipette to transfer the beer (not the foam) into 50ml Falcon tubes
* Make sure each tube gets the same quantity (to balance the centrifuge)
* Put a lid on each tube but don’t close them (CO2 needs to be evacuated)
* Put the tubes (with the lids) in the centrifuge
* Pre-cool the centrifuge so that it starts at 4℃
* Run the centrifuge for 10 min at full-speed and 4℃. This step separates the liquid phase and the solid phase (which contains yeast among other things)
* We take the solid stuff and put them in small tubes with 1ml buffer (tris/buffer 7.4 1M, neutral liquid). Mix what’s inside the tubes with a pipette. Label the tubes.
* These tubes will go to the centrifuge one more time for about 5 min at full-speed.
* Take the tubes out of the centrifuge and collect the pellet. Put the pellet into tubes. The next steps (13 to 15) are used to break the cell membranes.
* Put the tubes into nitrogen (we used something else than nitrogen at -80℃ and with alcohol, an ethanol bath)
* Add 200µl of  lysis buffer (2% Triter X-100, 1% SDS, 10mM NaCl, 10mM Tris HCl, 1mM EDTM) into each tube and suspend them
* Repeat 2 times
  * Put the tubes into an ethanol bath for 2 min
  * “Cook” them at 100℃ (boiling water) for 2 min
  * Vortex them for 30s
* Now we want to extract DNA from the tubes, which also contains buffer and cell garbage (steps 17 to 22). Gist: we add SPRI beads in a buffer containing PEG and NaCl so that the DNA binds to the beads. We use a magnet to capture the beads with the DNA. Then, we wash and repeat pretty much the same step: that time, beads will attach to the tube and the liquid will contain our DNA. In our case, we used an addition kit for this second step.
* Bind DNA to beads:
  * We combine all the tubes from 15. into one bigger tube.
  * We need a certain ratio of beads given the DNA we have (1.6), so pretend you do maths with a calculator for 15 sec
  * Split the sample into two samples (5µl each)
  * Vortex the buffer with beads
  * Mix by pipetting
  * Incubate for 5 min
  * Vortex the two samples
  * Use either a magnet or a magnetic rack to attach the beads for 1 min
* Washing:
  * Carefully remove the liquid from the tubes
  * Put a 70% Ethanol solution into each tube
  * Put the tubes back to the magnetic rack
  * Remove liquid carefully, you can use a tiny centrifuge
* Dry for 2 min
* Check the purity with a spectrophotometer
* We use a MinElute Reaction Kit 50 (qiagen) for the second extraction step:
  * Put the samples in a column
  * Centrifuge for 1 min (17900 g)
  * Add 750µl Buffer PE
  * Centrifuge for 1 min (17900 g)
  * Remove the liquid from the tube and put the column back
  * Centrifuge for 1 min to dry the column
  * Take the column out into a new tube and add 11µl water
  * Centrifuge for 1 min to elude the DNA from the column (the liquid into the tube now contains the DNA)
* We measured the quantity and purity using a spectrophotometer
* Freeze the DNA until library preparation

## Protocol: Library preparation

* Prepare tubes with 7.5µl DNA extracted as described above and 2.5µl FRA
* Mix gently
* Put the tubes into a thermocycler: 1min at 30℃, 1min at 80℃, after on ice until next step
* Attach an adapter (1µl of RAP) into the tube
* Mix gently with your fingers
* Incubate the reaction for 5 min at room temperature
* Store the library on ice until ready to load
