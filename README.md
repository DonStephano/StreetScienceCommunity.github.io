# What are we doing?

We are working with teachers, educators and citizens to educate the public about open science and particularly with sequencing, data-analysis, molecular biology, their benefits and implications.

# Who are we?

The members of the Black Science Education group are scientists from the [University of Freiburg](https://www.uni-freiburg.de/). 

# What do we need?

**You!** In whatever way you can help.

We need expertise in fundraising, science, education, communication, interaction with the public. We'd love your feedback along the way, and of course.
