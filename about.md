# What are we doing?

We are working with teachers, educators and citizens to educate the public about open science and particularly with sequencing, data-analysis, molecular biology, their benefits and implications.

## The problem

At a time when so many decisions are being made on the basis of science, it is becoming increasingly important to inform the public about the issues at stake. Popularization of science is then important to educate the public about the benefits and implications of the scientific news. It is particularly true for the biotechnologies and DNA sequencing.

## The solution

The Black Science Education group aims to bring science to the public. We organize workshops in which pupils, students and citizens manipulate come into contact with sequencing, data-analysis, molecular biology and open science. Our current main project is related to the DNA yeast in beer: [BeerDEcoded]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/beerdecoded.md)

# Who are we?

The members of the Black Science Education group are scientists from the [University of Freiburg](https://www.uni-freiburg.de/)
