With our BeerDEcoded project, we aim to organize workshops in which pupils, students and citizens come into contact with molecular biology, data-analysis, and open science by extracting, sequencing and analyzing the "DNA of beer". This project aims to sensibilize the participants to molecular biology and genomic related research, DNA sequencing and data analysis and the challenges and possibilities that genomics brings to our society.

We develop a first prototype of the DNA extraction and sequencing protocols using the [Nanopore MinION](https://nanoporetech.com/products/minion), a portable real-time device for DNA sequencing:

The results are very promising and the initial feedback is overwhelming. We have successfully identified specific brewing yeast strains from the DNA extracted out of bottled beer. For the data analysis, we create a workflow using Galaxy. This open source, web-based platform makes reproducible computational biology and bioinformatics accessible to anyone with web-access.

To support the workshop, training material are creating in cooperation with the Galaxy Training community and GOBLET. We produce slides, hands-on material, interactive web-tours suitable to guide our participants from data upload to data analysis. 

The [protocols]({{ site.baseurl }}/protocols) used for the DNA extraction and sequencing, the workflows, the sequencing data, and the training materials are developed in an open collaborative environment, adhering to the open science principles and shared online. We are aiming at providing a template project for other communities around the globe to pursue similar efforts locally.
